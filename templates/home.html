            <h4>In 2000, Charles Best, a teacher at a Bronx public high school, wanted his students to read Little
                House on the Prairie. As he was making photocopies of the one book he could procure, Charles thought
                about all the money he and his colleagues were spending on books, art supplies, and other materials.</h4>

            <h4>    And he figured there were people out there who'd want to help â€” if they could see where their money
                was going. Charles sketched out a website where teachers could post classroom project requests, and
                donors could choose the ones they wanted to support. His colleagues posted the first 11 requests. Then
                it spread. Today, we're open to every public school in America.</h4>
